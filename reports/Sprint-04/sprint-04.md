## UI/UX Artifacts
<img src = "images/mainPage.png">
A front end template of the home page was created. The Login/Sign Up button leads to the login page below:
<img src = "images/loginPage.png">

On a successful login, the user will be redirected to the main page where they may search for a group based on course, or create a group:
<img src = "images/courseSearch.png">
When “Create a Group” is clicked, it will bring the user to a screen where they fill out a form to create a group:
<img src = "images/registerGroup.png">
Currently, the pages are still only front end HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and are not live. The color palettes are subject to updates and the pictures are placeholders.

All pages were made based off of the wireframes of the flow of the website under the diagrams folder in Github.
