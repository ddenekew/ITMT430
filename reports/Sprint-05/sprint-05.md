# Sprint-05 Written Report

## Team Number 09

Daniel Denekew *IT Infrastructure, Jr. Developer*

Pablo Villagomez *Project Manager, Developer*

Desmond Mair *UI/UX Developer, Developer*


### UI/UX Artifacts

- List all tasks that you have completed along with the artifacts proving they are complete (GitHub commit URL and Project Management artifact screenshot)
- Show (screenshot with highlights) all UI/UX components added since sprint-04 for the User Story and give a short explanation of their function
- Show (screenshot with highlights) all UI/UX components added since sprint-04 for the Admin Story and/or Anonymous user and give a short explanation of their function
- Add screenshot of a minimum of 5 additional GitHub issues/bugs reported, assigned, and resolved


### Developer

- We attempted to link our front-end with our back-end, however, we were not successful as we struggled with setting up our database and server.
- The following link is for the commits of our first attempt of setting up our database and server using MongoDB/Node.js.
https://github.com/illinoistech-itm/2020-team09f/commit/aa5cedf4de3632bdc715f0a4e278def81937744c
- They include the required dependencies, but other team members were not able to set up the server/database on their end. Afterwards, we attempted to build our server and database based on the example given by Professor Jeremy as shown in our infrastructure report.


### Infrastructure

- List all tasks that you have completed along with the artifacts proving they are complete (GitHub
commit URL and Project Management artifact screenshot)
- Create a virtual machine based Load-Balancer to route between two copies of the front end virtual
machines (For example: Nginx)
- Include a script that will build each of these discrete systems as virtual machines automatically,
include instructions how to do this in the install.md located in the root of the GitHub repo
  - At a minimum of 4 systems: Load Balancer, Frontend 1, Frontend 2, Backend-datastore
- Include in the Diagrams folder a diagram of all of the discrete servers and their IP addresses in
your application (All systems need to be on a discrete server)
- Include a list of external packages per system being installed for this application via package
manager that were added or removed since sprint-04


### Junior Developer

- List all tasks that you have completed along with the artifacts proving they are complete (GitHub
commit URL and Project Management artifact screenshot)
- Create a feature and functionality on the Admin portal of your site that allows an admin to export
(or dump) the entire database to a local file
- For the 15 “test” user accounts, create 2 actions per user upon automated deploy of the system
  - For instance, have each user buy two things, or make two posts, or two uploaded photos, or
flip two buttons
- Show from the code the firewall ports opened on each discrete vm

### Project Manager

In terms of our final deliverable, we have our front-end completed. The front-end depicts our intended user story as well as our admin story. The forefront was created to accurately represent the Illinois Tech spirit and it is responsive to any device or screen size. However, as great as our front-end might be, we have not been able to add back-end functionality to make it all complete. We struggled to link our database/server to the front-end. At first, we attempted to follow our original goal of using MongoDB/Node.js, but failed at making it run with the front-end. So then we tried to follow the examples given by Prof Jeremy, but were also unsuccessful at getting it to link to our front end. Therefore, we do not have a live demonstration we can recreate because our final deliverable is not executable.
